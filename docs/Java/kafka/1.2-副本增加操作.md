# 记录一次增加副本数的操作

操作前：

可以看到目前 __consumer_offsets 此topic的副本全部在broker 0上，现在想把此topic的副本增加到所有机器上，仍然是先生成建议的转移json字符串，并进行修改：

```

使用上面的json文件会导致出错，错误如下：

```shell
[root@name1 bin]# ./kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper name1:2181 --reassignment-json-file reas2.json  --execute 
Partitions reassignment failed due to Size of replicas list Vector(0, 1, 2) is different from size of log dirs list Vector(any) for partition __consumer_offsets-49

把log_dirs 此item去除调，修改后如下：
