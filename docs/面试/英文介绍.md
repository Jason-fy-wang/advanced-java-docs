Good afternoon,interviewer. My name is wangkai,graduated from hebei North University in 2016.My major is electronic information engineering from 2012 to 2016.I used to work in beijing, and came to guangzhou in 2019 and worked in wistron(纬创) until now, mainly engaged in nfvo project of China Mobile. The main responsibility of myself  in the project is to lead the development of four modules. They are Alarm Processinig module, Collecting Source management module,Collect module and System Monitor module.

Let me briefly introduce the functions of each module.The Alarm Processing module mainly deals with the collected alarm data as required; The Collecting Source module  mainly abstracts the network element as the collection source and manages it. A network element is a group of devices, including firewall,server,disk matrix,switch etc, that perform certain functions as a unit;  The Collecting module mainly collects data by using http, https, ftp, sftp and socket; The System monitoring module is mainly to collect the information of each module, middleware and system in the project, as well as to recover some abnormal operations. its implementation is mainly realized througn ZABBIX,shell script and python.
The above is a brief introduction of my study and work experience. Thank you very much.

面试官,上午/下午好, 我叫王凯,2016年毕业于河北北方学院.专业是电子信息工程,到今天为止服务过三家公司. 之前工作在北京,2019年来到广州,工作与纬创到现在, 主要从事中国移动的NFVO项目. 自己主要承担其中的4个模块开发,分别是 告警处理,采集源管理模块,采集模块以及监控系统模块. 
下面我简单介绍一下这几个模块的大体功能: 告警模块主要是对告警数据的处理;采集源模块主要是对抽象为采集源的网元管理,网元是一组设备组成，包含了防火墙、服务器、磁盘矩阵、交换机等，并以此为单位来承担一定的功能;采集模块是把对应的采集源对应数据采集上来,采集方式主要有http,https,ftp,sftp和socket; 系统监控模块主要是对项目中各个模块，中间件以及系统信息的采集，以及针对一些异常的恢复操作，其实现主要是通过zabbix，shell script和python实现.以上就是我的学习和工作的简介,谢谢大家.

Why do you choose to develop here in guangzhou ?
I come here mainly because my girlfriend is here, I like her very much and I want to marry her and live with her, so I choose to work and develop here.

Why did you choose to leave from your last company?
There are three main reasons why I choose to leave my last company:
1. Up to now, the project has been in the stage of completion, there are basically no new requirements, and there will be no new projects in a short time.
2. My goal is to be an experienced architect and to find a more challenging job
3. last year,I married my girlfriend and wanted to make more money to give here a good life.


What is your plan for a short time?
In depth understanding of the project business, mining the demand, reverse promote the technical level of myself , help the business implementation.  In this way, we can become an experienced engineer.

What is your role in the project?
One of the main developers in the project.I deeply partictipated in the project's needs research，design，technlogy selection, project developement, project deployment,project operation and maintenance in various states.In the early and middle of the project, undertake the online middleware deployment and operation work required by the project, write relevant automation scripts and share them with the team members.


How do you understand micro service?
Microservice is a development concept, under which we can split the project according to business or function. The split project can be developed synchronously and iterated in small steps, which greatly shortens the development cycle.With this concept, agile development, continuous delivery(CD) and continuous integration(CI) can be realized.  Compared with microservice, DDD is a smaller granularity partition
